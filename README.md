# Python-Project

The Survival Duration Calculator is a Python-based program 
that calculates the duration of a person’s life in various time units—months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, 
and seconds—based on their age. 
This project is designed to demonstrate simple mathematical operations, user interaction, and modular coding practices.
